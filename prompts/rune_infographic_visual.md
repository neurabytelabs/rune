Create a stunning dark-themed technical infographic showing the RUNE prompt engineering framework. Style: cyberpunk meets ancient magic, dark background with magenta-to-cyan gradients.

LEFT: A simple raw text prompt floating dim and gray - labeled "Raw Prompt"

CENTER: A large glowing runic mandala with Elder Futhark ᚱ symbol at center. 8 concentric glowing orbital rings representing layers: System Core (white), Context & Identity (violet), Intent & Scope (blue), Governance & Safety (green), Cognitive Engine (cyan), Capabilities (yellow), Output Architecture (orange), Meta & Evolution (magenta). Small runic symbols scattered along rings. An orchestrator wizard silhouette with glowing wand behind the mandala conducting energy flows.

RIGHT: A beautifully structured glowing document emerging - labeled "Enhanced Prompt" with "Spinoza Score: 94/100". Multiple arrows to different AI model icons.

BOTTOM: 3-4 semi-transparent holographic future rune cards materializing: SYNTHESIS (multi-prompt fusion), MEMORY (persistent evolution), SWARM (multi-agent), ORACLE (self-improving). Marked as coming soon, ethereal feel.

TOP: "RUNE" title with magenta-cyan gradient. Subtitle: "Every prompt is a spell." Small "v1.0 | NeuraByte Labs"

Style: technical blueprint meets arcane grimoire. Particle effects, energy flows, glow. Colors: deep black background, magenta #E040FB, cyan #06B6D4, violet #7C3AED. Monospace typography feel. High detail.
